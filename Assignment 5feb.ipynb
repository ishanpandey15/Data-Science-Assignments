    "The four pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1)Encapsulation: Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) together within a class. It allows the class to control the access and manipulation of its own data. By encapsulating data, we can hide the internal implementation details and provide a clean and organized interface for interacting with objects. Encapsulation also helps in achieving data abstraction and data hiding.\n",
    "\n",
    "2)Inheritance: Inheritance enables the creation of new classes (derived classes) based on existing classes (base or parent classes). The derived classes inherit the attributes and methods of the base class, allowing for code reuse and the extension of existing functionality. Inheritance promotes code organization, modularity, and hierarchical relationships among classes. It allows for the creation of specialized classes that inherit and override behaviors from more general classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3)Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. It refers to the ability of objects to take on different forms and respond differently to the same method call. Polymorphism enables code flexibility, extensibility, and dynamic behavior. It allows for the use of generic code that can operate on objects of different types, as long as they adhere to a common interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "4)Abstraction: Abstraction involves the representation of essential features and behaviors of real-world objects in a simplified manner. It focuses on capturing the relevant characteristics of an object while hiding unnecessary details. Abstraction allows us to create abstract classes or interfaces that define the common structure and behavior of a group of related objects. It helps in managing complexity, promoting code reusability, and providing a clear separation between the interface and implementation"
