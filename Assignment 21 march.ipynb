    "Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding are two techniques for transforming categorical data into numerical data. Categorical data are variables that contain label values rather than numeric values, such as “pet”, “color” or “place”.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinal Encoding is suitable when categorical variables have an inherent order or ranking, such as “place” with values “first”, “second” and “third”. Ordinal Encoding assigns an integer value to each category based on the rank, such as 1 for “first”, 2 for “second” and 3 for “third”. This preserves the order of the categories in the numerical representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Label Encoding is appropriate when encoding target variables, especially for categorical variables with no inherent order, such as “pet” with values “dog” and “cat”. Label Encoding assigns an integer value to each category arbitrarily, such as 0 for “dog” and 1 for “cat”. This does not preserve any order or relationship between the categories in the numerical representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "One might choose Ordinal Encoding over Label Encoding when the categorical variable has a natural order and the order is relevant for the machine learning model. For example, if you want to predict the grade of a student based on their exam score, you can use Ordinal Encoding to transform the grade variable into numerical values, such as A=5, B=4, C=3, D=2 and F=1. This way, the model can learn the relationship between the exam score and the grade.\n",

    "One might choose Label Encoding over Ordinal Encoding when the categorical variable has no natural order or the order is not relevant for the machine learning model. For example, if you want to predict whether a customer will buy a product based on their gender, you can use Label Encoding to transform the gender variable into numerical values, such as Male=0 and Female=1. This way, the model can learn the association between the gender and the purchase decision"

    "Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is a data preprocessing technique used to convert categorical variables into ordinal numerical values based on their relationship with the target variable in a supervised machine learning problem. The idea behind this technique is to leverage the information contained in the target variable to create meaningful ordinal ranks for the categories of the categorical variable.\n",

    "Here's how Target Guided Ordinal Encoding works:\n",

    "\n",
    "Replace Categories: Replace the original categorical values with the corresponding ordinal ranks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say you're working on a loan approval prediction task. You have a categorical feature \"Credit Score Group\" with categories \"Poor,\" \"Fair,\" \"Good,\" and \"Excellent.\" Your target variable is whether a loan application was approved (1 for approved, 0 for not approved).\n",
    "\n",
    "You calculate the mean approval rate for each credit score group:\n",
    "\n",
    "Poor: 0.10\n",
    "Fair: 0.25\n",
    "Good: 0.70\n",
    "Excellent: 0.90\n",

    "\n",
    "Excellent\n",
    "Good\n",
    "Fair\n",
    "Poor\n",
    "Then you assign ordinal ranks:\n",
    "\n",
    "Poor: 4\n",
    "Fair: 3\n",
    "Good: 2\n",
    "Excellent: 1\n",
    "Finally, you replace the original categories with the ordinal ranks in your dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "When to use Target Guided Ordinal Encoding:\n",
    "\n",
    "You might use Target Guided Ordinal Encoding when you suspect that the categorical variable has a significant impact on the target variable and there's a clear order or trend between the categories and the target variable. This technique can capture the information contained in the categorical variable more effectively than traditional ordinal encoding methods, especially when there is a non-linear relationship between the categorical variable and the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the loan approval example, using Target Guided Ordinal Encoding could help the model learn the ordinal relationship between credit score groups and loan approval rates, potentially leading to better performance in predicting loan approvals."
