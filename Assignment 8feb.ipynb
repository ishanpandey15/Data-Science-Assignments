    "Define Private Attributes: Use naming conventions to indicate that certain attributes are intended to be private. Although Python does not enforce strict access control like some other languages, developers conventionally use a single underscore prefix (e.g., _attribute_name) to indicate that an attribute should be considered private and not accessed directly from outside the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Getter and Setter Methods: Instead of directly accessing or modifying the attributes, provide getter and setter methods to retrieve and modify the attribute values. This way, the internal representation of the data can be hidden, and the class can perform any necessary validations or computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Property Decorators: Python's property decorators allow you to define getter and setter methods as if they were attributes. By using the @property decorator for the getter and @attribute_name.setter decorator for the setter, you can achieve a more elegant syntax for accessing and modifying attributes while still retaining control over the implementation."
