    " A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and stored in a computer system. It is designed to efficiently manage, manipulate, and retrieve data.

    "SQL databases are based on the relational model, where data is organized into tables consisting of rows and columns.\n",

    "DDL stands for Data Definition Language. It is a set of SQL statements used to define and manage the structure of a database. DDL statements are responsible for creating, altering, and deleting database objects such as tables, indexes, views, and constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an explanation of the commonly used DDL statements with examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE:\n",
    "The CREATE statement is used to create new database objects, such as tables, views, indexes, or schemas. It specifies the structure, name, and other properties of the object being created. For example:\n",
    "sql\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "CREATE TABLE Employees (\n",
    "    ID INT,\n",
    "    Name VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "    Department VARCHAR(50)\n",
    ");\n",
    "This statement creates a table named \"Employees\" with columns for ID, Name, and Department.\n",
    "\n",
    "DROP:\n",
    "The DROP statement is used to remove or delete existing database objects, such as tables or views. It permanently deletes the object and all associated data. For example:\n",
    "sql\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "DROP TABLE Employees;\n",
    "This statement drops the \"Employees\" table from the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "ALTER:\n",
    "The ALTER statement is used to modify the structure of an existing database object, such as adding or removing columns from a table or modifying constraints. For example:\n",
    "sql\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "ALTER TABLE Employees\n",
    "ADD COLUMN Salary DECIMAL(10, 2);\n",
    "This statement alters the \"Employees\" table by adding a new column called \"Salary\" of type DECIMAL(10, 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "TRUNCATE:\n",
    "The TRUNCATE statement is used to remove all rows from a table, but the table structure and its definition remain intact. It is a faster alternative to the DELETE statement when you want to remove all data from a table. For example:\n",
    "sql\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "TRUNCATE TABLE Employees;\n",
    "This statement removes all rows from the \"Employees\" table, but the table structure remains.\n",
