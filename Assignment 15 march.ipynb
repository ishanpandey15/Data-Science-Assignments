It contains labeled examples (input data paired with corresponding output labels) on which the model learns the patterns and relationships in the data. During training, the model adjusts its internal parameters to minimize the error between its predictions and the true labels. The larger the training set, the better the model can learn the underlying patterns in the data.\n",

    "Unsupervised learning can be used effectively in anomaly detection, which involves identifying rare and unusual patterns or data points that deviate significantly from the normal behavior. Anomaly detection is challenging because anomalies are often not well-defined and may not have labeled examples for training. Unsupervised learning algorithms can be valuable in this context as they can discover patterns in the data without the need for labeled anomaly examples. Here's how unsupervised learning can be applied to anomaly detection:\n",
    "\n",
    "Clustering-based Anomaly Detection: Unsupervised clustering algorithms, such as K-means or DBSCAN, can be used to group data points based on their similarity. Anomalies are then identified as data points that do not belong to any cluster or belong to very small or sparse clusters.\n",

    "\n",
    "Autoencoders for Anomaly Detection: Autoencoders are unsupervised neural network architectures used for dimensionality reduction and feature learning. When trained on normal data, autoencoders try to reconstruct the input with minimal error. Anomalies, being different from normal data, result in higher reconstruction errors, making them easier to identify.\n",

    "One-class SVM: One-class SVM is a support vector machine algorithm that is trained on normal data to create a boundary around the majority of the data. Any data point falling outside this boundary is considered an anomaly.\n",

    "Statistical Methods: Unsupervised statistical methods, such as Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) or Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), can be used to model the distribution of normal data. Data points with low likelihood under the learned distribution are considered anomalies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of using unsupervised learning for anomaly detection is that it can adapt to changes in the data distribution and identify novel anomalies that were not seen during training. However, unsupervised methods may also be prone to false positives and false negatives, and careful selection and fine-tuning of the algorithm's parameters are required."
